# Graphic Editor
The graphic editor page consists of several components: a toolbar, a canvas, and an information panel for the selected shape.

## Toolbar
The toolbar consists of two sub-components: a shapes panel and a modes panel. The modes panel consists of four modes: select, draw, delete, and edit. Select allows you to select a shape and view detailed information about it. Draw allows you to add new shapes. Delete removes a previously drawn shape. Edit allows you to move shapes.
The shapes panel contains three elements: rectangle, triangle, and circle. The user selects the shape they wish to draw using the draw mode.

## Canvas
The canvas occupies the largest part of the graphic editor and is a gridded field. Here you can draw, modify, and delete shapes.
