# Graphic Editor
## Summary
A significant and necessary component of the intelligent learning system is the user interface â€“ a graphic editor designed for working with geometric shapes.

One of the project's goals was to create such a specialized graphic editor, allowing users to work with the visual representation of geometric figures.

In addition to its primary function, the developed tool also provides other features: a smart chat assistant capable of interacting with the user and answering related questions, and authentication and authorization functionality.
